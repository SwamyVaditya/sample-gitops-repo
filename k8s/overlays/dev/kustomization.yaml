# Dev overlay kustomization.yaml
# - Adds 'dev-' prefix to resource names
# - Sets namespace to 'dev'
# - Applies patches to Deployment and Ingress
# - Updates container image tag for development version
# - Uses environment label transformer for additional labeling
# Reference base kustomization.yaml for common configurations
# located at ../../base/kustomization.yaml
# This overlay is tailored for the development environment
# ensuring proper resource naming, namespace assignment,
# and image versioning specific to dev deployments.
# Prefix ensures resource names don’t collide across environments.
# Namespace isolates dev resources within the cluster.
# Patches customize base resources for dev-specific settings.
